## Results 

### Time Serise Results
Based on the above test results I would not buy the yen now. several factors have lead me to this conclusion: 
1. The ARIMA & ARMA both have p-values greater that .05, indicating no statistical significance. 
2. An upward trending GARCH model tells me that the exchange rates arte predicted to rise. 

I this was a real life situation I would not feel confident using these models for trading. I would personally gather more information before I make a decision. 

### Regression results 
The results of this test show a out-of-sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of .596 which is lower than the in-sample RMSE of .415. These results indicate that the mopdel will make better predictions on test data than actual data.
